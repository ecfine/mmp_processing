1. LS164234 is the first gauge used in mmp1.  It is a Lucas Schaevitz strain
gauge Type P993-004 serial # 164234.  The calibration of 01mar94 assumes the
manufacturer's specification of 0 to 35 bar (3.5 MPa) absolute for a linear
voltage output of 0 to +5 volts, except we use Jack's measurement of full scale of
5.009 volts.

2. On 26 Jan 95 the gauge was calibrated with a dead-weight tester having 0.1%
accuracy (1.2 psi) on a 1200 psi range.  The output voltage was recorded using
MPU run on a MacIIfx.  The calibration was found be be nonlinear to about 0.5 kPa,
so a third-order polynomial fit was used, as that was the lowest order fit
producing random residuals.  The residuals were +/- 0.15 kPa or less.

3. The original gauge in mmp3, Paros60095, was damaged by leaking water during
tests in Lake Washington during July 1996.  For cmo96, it was replaced by
Paros1632, an older gauge without an accompanying thermistor.  This gauge
had been used in an earlier version of mmp1 or mmp2.

4. Paros62954 was put in mmp3 for the Lake Washington tests on March 19, 1997.
The first drop was 4187.
