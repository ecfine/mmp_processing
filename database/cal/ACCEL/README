   This directory contains 1) configuration files for accelerometer data channels, 2) parameter files for accelerometer electronics, and 3) calibration coefficients for the accelerometers.

CONFIGURATION FILES
   These file have names like "a1_mmp1_config" and contain lines with: the first and last drop numbers for a configuration, the channel parameter file to use, and
the calibration file to use.  Initially, at least, we do not expect changes in either
the electronics or the calibrations and each file has only one line.  The structure,
however, can accomodate changes.  As an example, a1_mmp1_config contains the following line
     1 100000 a1_mmp1_01mar94 ks_3c13042_16sep92

PARAMETER FILES
   As of December 1994, the circuit parameters are simply the gains of linear
circuits applied to the accelerometer outputs.  Parameter files are labeled
with the data channel and the date of their first application.  As an example,
a1_mmp1_01mar94 contains  the following line
   1 100000 100

indicating that Gac=100 is to be used for drops 1 to 100,000.

CALIBRATION FILES
		There is one file per calibration per sensor.  For instance, ks_3c13042 and ks_3c13050 are model 3140-002 units made by KSsensors of Milpitas, CA and have serial numbers 3c13042 and 3c13050.  The calibrations are outputs in volts per g at 100 Hz.  As an example, ks_3c13042_16sep92 contains the following line
   1.011
