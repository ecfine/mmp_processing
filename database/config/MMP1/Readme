1. Pressure sensor LS164234 is a Lucas Schaevitz strain gauge type P993-0004,
   serial number 164234.

2. The first arrangement of external sensors has tsbe in sensorport 1, 
csbe in sensorport2, th1 in case t1 in sensorport3, v2 in case af1 in sensorport4,
th2 in case t2 in sensorport5, and v1 in case af1 in sensorport6.  

3. The first arrangement of the data scan connects Sensorport1 to the 1st 3 bytes 
of row 2, sensorport2 to the first 3 bytes of row 3, sensorport3 in column4, 
sensorport4 in column 7, sensorport 5 in column 5, and sensorport6 in column 6.

4. Starting with Lake Washington tests in Feb96 (mmp drop 2131), 
	a. A ParoScientific pressure gauge replaced the strain gauge.  It is sampled 
	   at 25 Hz, and the data are in the first three bytes of row 4 in a data 
	   scan.  mmp1 has gauge serial number 60094.
	   
	b. Temperature at the new pressure gauge was also added.  It is sampled at
		25 Hz, and the data are in row6col1.
		
	c.	An optical backscatterance sensor was added so it can be interchanged
		th2, i.e. it is installed in data port 5 and the data appear in column
		5 of the data scan.
		
	d.	The altimeter circuitry was changed to allow ping rates of 1.25, 2.5, and
		5 Hz.
