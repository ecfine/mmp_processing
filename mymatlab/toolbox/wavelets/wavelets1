function Wout =  sucwavecoef(Vin,g,K);
% Usage: Wout =  sucwavecoef(Vin,g,K);
%   inputs:
%     Vin: original time series
%     g: wavelet filter
%     K: the order of decomposition
%        for the Kth order, the resolved time scale is 2^(K)-2^(K+1)
%        times the time interval
%   output
%   Wout : Wavelet Coefficients
% Function: 
%Mike,
%   The following is my function to calculate wavelet coefficients.
%   
%    dwdtWout =   sucwaveletcoef(demean(dwdt),LA8,maxK); 
%   
% You need to provide the mother wavelet. They are in /j/users/lien/s/mymatlab/
% dbpwavelet/scaling. LA 8 and D10 are the ones I often used. maxK is the
% maximum number of timescale bands you want to use. The total number of
% points of your time series N < 2^maxK. 
%
%    The function calls modwtfast. It is a C routine and will be included in
% my next email. Please compile it in your machine.
 

   Z = zeros(size(Vin));

   for i=1:K;
       [W,V]=modwtfast(Vin,g,i);
       Vin = V;
       Wout(i,:) = W(:)';
   end
