function z=spderiv(x,y,xi)
%SPDERIV Cubic Spline Derivative Interpolation.
% YI=SPDERIV(X,Y,XI) uses cubic spline interpolation to fit the
% data in X and Y, differentiates the spline, and returns values
% of the spline derivatives evaluated at the points in XI.
%
% PPD=SPDERIV(PP) returns the piecewise polynomial vector PPD
% describing the cubic spline derivative of the curve described by
% the piecewise polynomial in PP. PP is returned by the function
% SPLINE and is a data vector containing all information to
% evaluate and manipulate a spline. 
%
% YI=SPDERIV(PP,XI) differentiates the cubic spline given by
% the piecewise polynomial PP, and returns the values of the
% spline derivatives evaluated at the points in XI.
