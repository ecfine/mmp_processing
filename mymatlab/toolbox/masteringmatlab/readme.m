% These M-files are User Contributed Routines that are being redistributed
% by The Mathworks, upon request, on an "as is" basis. A User Contributed
% Routine is not a product of The Mathworks, Inc. and The Mathworks assumes
% no responsibility for any errors that may exist in these routines.
%
% While a reasonable effort has been made to create error-free M-files,
% the authors of these User Contributed Routines assume no responsibility
% for any errors that may exist in these routines. Moreover, the authors
% do not accept any liability for errors that may result from the use of
% these routines.
